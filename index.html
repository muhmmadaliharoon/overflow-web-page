            <legend>History Of BodyBuilding:</legend>
            <legend class="abc3"> competitions were practiced in ancient Egypt, Greece, and Tamilakam.[7] Western weightlifting developed in Europe from 1880 to 1953, with strongmen displaying feats of strength for the public and challenging each other. The focus was not on their physique, and they possessed relatively large bellies and fatty limbs compared to bodybuilders of today.[8]</legend>

            <legend>Bodybuilding:</legend>
            <legend class="abc3"> Bodybuilding is the practice of progressive resistance exercise to build, control, and develop one's muscles via hypertrophy.[1] An individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder. It is primarily undertaken for aesthetic purposes over functional ones, distinguishing it from similar activities such as powerlifting, which focuses solely on increasing the physical load one can exert.</legend>

            <legend>Eugen Sandow:</legend>
            <legend class="abc3">Bodybuilding developed in the late 19th century, promoted in England by Eugen Sandow. He allowed audiences to enjoy viewing his physique in "muscle display performances". Although audiences were thrilled to see a well-developed physique, the men simply displayed their bodies as part of strength demonstrations or wrestling matches. Sandow had a stage show built around these displays through his manager, Florenz Ziegfeld. The Oscar-winning 1936 musical film The Great Ziegfeld depicts the beginning of modern bodybuilding, when Sandow began to display his body for carnivals.[9]</legend>
